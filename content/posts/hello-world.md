**Harvesting Soybean.**

Janguma, Afayak and Favour are some of the names of various varieties of soyabeans grown in Ghana and farmers choose the variety to plant based on their individual characteristics. 

**AgroNorth** decided to go in for favour which is a new variety that was introduced in Ghana by the Council for Scientific Research - Savannah Agricultural Research Institute ( CSIR -SARI ) in 2019.

Interestingly , this new variety was named favor because of the many qualities it possess. It tends to enrich the soil by sheltering more leaves which serves as organic matter to the soil. It yields more than other varieties, it is also more resistant to diseases and it has low shattering.

**AgroNorth** distributed this new variety to 360 farmers in 3 different communities namely Nagdigu, Yemo-Karaga and Kutung.
